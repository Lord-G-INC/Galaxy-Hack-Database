# How to add your hack
To add your hack, Fork the repository and create a new file. The file should be named after your hack. For example, if your hack is named Super Mario Galaxy 3 then your filename would be `SMG3.md`. Use one of the Template files in this Repository as a base for your file. Use the WIP one for an unfinished hack. When you are done, make a Pull Request. If your hack is approved, it will be added to the main repository

# What counts as a "Hack"
We're talking levels here. So if it's a level, you're free to add it using the steps above.<br/>Level Collections (Such as Neo Mario Galaxy) are also allowed.<br/>Dead or Cancelled hacks (Such as SMG2.5) are not allowed.

# Entry Guidelines
- The download must be a direct download, or a link to a file hosting site, like MEGA.nz. **Do Not Link Videos For this**
- Github has a Filesize Limit, so keep your images under 100MB. If your images break in the preview, try making them smaller
- If your hack is released in any capacity, use the [Release Template](Templates/TEMPLATE_RELEASED)
- Videos such as trailers and showcases are to be linked inside the Gallery section. Each link must declare the video hosting site. Example: [My epic trailer on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntN_2l8hKug)
- README table entries should in the order the files show up on GitHub (in alphabetical order of the filenames)
- When adding your entry DO NOT DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN ADDING YOUR FILE! PRs WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED IF THEY HAVE CHANGES THAT ARE MADE TO FILES OTHER THAN YOUR OWN HACK
